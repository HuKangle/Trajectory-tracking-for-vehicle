# Homothetic-Tube-based MPC for Trajectory-tracking 
We will present the matlab code and the simulation scheme in a Simulink environment. We will also give a brief result of the simulation.
The Simulink file will use the S-function to implement the proposed algorithm, including the HT-MPC, MPC, TMPC. 
The tracking errors are also calculated in the S-function file. 
The S-function produce the steer angle to the simulation platform Carsim that output the vehicle dynamical states to the S-function.
Within the HT-MPC framework, the tube-calucation and the local control law are achieved to complement the HT-MPC.
